# NCAA_basketball_analysis

# Background
 The purpose of this project is to scrape ncaa basketball stats from the internet. After data is collected, run some statistical analysis and create some visualizations that explain the data.
# HouseKeeping
  * Currently all stats were scraped from www.ncaa.com.
    * Stats stored in csv files in Resources folder
  * Looking into using TeamRankings.com instead because they have historical data.
  * Eventually:
    * Create a dashboard that will display stats and visualizations
    * train a machine learning algorythm that will analyze stats and attempt to predict game outcomes
      * ideally fill out a march madness bracket
